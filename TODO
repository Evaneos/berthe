1°) Remove "Evaneos_" class prefix
=> Implies changes in all Evaneos code


2°) Remove all calls to Zend_Registry
=> Implies dependency injection in Evaneos code
i.e. : Remove the Zend_Registry::get('dbReader') from Berthe_AbstractReader 
implies a $reader->setDb($db) in Evaneos code to make the code works !


3°) Remove all calls to Berthe_Modules
=> i.e. : Instanciation of Memcached requires the Site object
(there are also extra magic strings in that same class that have to be removed as well)

4°) Switch to namespace


5°) Reorganize folder tree :
Berthe
    Model
        AbstractService.php
        AbstractManager.php
        AbstractValidator.php
        ErrorHandler.php
    DAL
        Store
            AbstractStore.php
            StoreArray.php
            StoreDatabase.php
            StoreMemcached.php
        AbstractStorage.php
        AbstractVO.php
        ComplexPaginator.php
    Component
        Memcached.php
        Redis.php
...

6°) Remove dependency to Log_Logger

7°) Remove dependency to ROOT_DIR constant

8°) Refactor Berthe/Generator/Util so that it becomes 100% agnostic

9°) Add an interface to Db/Mc/Redis components so that they can be used with any 
implementation, not only Zend (even if we just make an interface that 
matches zend one, (which will actually help, no need to create adapters in project impl!)
